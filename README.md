## Project Overview

**QuLab** is a Streamlit-based educational application designed to explore the concepts of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), with a particular focus on the Economic Value of Equity (EVE). This interactive tool allows users to simulate the impact of various interest rate shocks on a bank's economic value by generating synthetic banking book portfolios, creating yield curves, calculating cash flows, and performing stress tests.

The application aims to provide a practical understanding of how changes in market interest rates can affect a bank's net worth and profitability, incorporating key regulatory concepts such as ŒîEVE and Net Gap analysis.

### Key Concepts Explored:

*   **IRRBB (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book):** The risk to a bank's earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates.
*   **EVE (Economic Value of Equity):** Represents the present value of a bank's expected cash flows from its assets minus the present value of its expected cash flows from its liabilities. It's a measure of the bank's long-term economic net worth.
    $$ EVE_{\text{baseline}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_A} PV(CF_{A,i}) - \sum_{j=1}^{N_L} PV(CF_{L,j}) $$
    Where:
    *   $N_A$ is the number of assets.
    *   $N_L$ is the number of liabilities.
    *   $PV(CF_{A,i})$ is the present value of the cash flows of asset $i$.
    *   $PV(CF_{L,j})$ is the present value of the cash flows of liability $j$.
*   **Present Value (PV) Calculation:** The value today of a future stream of cash flows.
    $$ PV(CF_t) = \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r_t)^{t}} $$
    or
    $$ PV = \sum_{k=1}^{M} \frac{CF_k}{(1 + r_{t_k})^{t_k}} $$
    Where:
    *   $CF_t$ is the cash flow at time t.
    *   $r_t$ is the discount rate for time t.
    *   $r_{t_k}$ is the discount rate for time $t_k$.
*   **ŒîEVE (Change in Economic Value of Equity):** The shift in EVE under a defined interest rate shock scenario, relative to a baseline EVE. This is a critical metric used by regulators (e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) to assess IRRBB.
    $$ \Delta EVE = EVE_{\text{shocked}} - EVE_{\text{baseline}} $$
    $$ \Delta EVE (\% \text{ Tier 1 Capital}) = \frac{\Delta EVE}{\text{Tier 1 Capital}} \times 100\% $$
*   **Net Gap Analysis:** A simplified measure of interest rate risk exposure, representing the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities within defined time buckets. A positive gap indicates asset sensitivity, while a negative gap indicates liability sensitivity.
    $$ Net\ Gap_{\text{bucket } k} = \sum_{\text{assets in bucket } k} CF_{\text{in}} - \sum_{\text{liabilities in bucket } k} CF_{\text{out}} $$

## ‚ú® Features

QuLab offers the following key functionalities:

*   **üìà Portfolio Generation:**
    *   Generate a synthetic banking book portfolio with configurable numbers of instruments, Tier 1 Capital, and date ranges.
    *   Includes a mix of assets (Loans, Bonds, Mortgages) and liabilities (Deposits), as well as Swaps.
    *   Instruments feature diverse characteristics: Issue Date, Maturity Date, Amount, Rate Type (Fixed, Floating, Hybrid), Coupon Rate, Payment Frequency, and specific features (e.g., prepayment options for mortgages, NMD flags for deposits).
*   **üìä Discount Curve Management:**
    *   Generate a baseline discount (yield) curve based on market rates and adjustable liquidity spreads.
    *   Visualize the generated yield curve to understand its shape and rates across different tenors.
*   **üí° IRRBB Simulation & Analysis:**
    *   **Cash Flow Generation:** Automatically generate projected cash flows for each instrument in the portfolio (principal and interest payments).
    *   **Behavioral Assumptions:** Apply behavioral models for instruments like Mortgages (prepayment) and Non-Maturity Deposits (NMDs - behavioral maturity and beta).
    *   **Basel Bucketing:** Map cash flows into predefined Basel IRRBB time buckets for granular analysis.
    *   **Present Value Calculation:** Discount future cash flows using the generated yield curves to calculate the present value of assets and liabilities.
    *   **Interest Rate Shock Scenarios:** Apply standard Basel-defined interest rate shock scenarios (e.g., Parallel Up/Down, Steepener, Flattener, Short Rate Up/Down).
    *   **Dynamic Repricing:** Re-price floating rate instrument cash flows and adjust behavioral assumptions (e.g., prepayment rates) under different shock scenarios.
    *   **EVE & ŒîEVE Calculation:** Compute the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) under baseline and shocked scenarios, and determine the change (ŒîEVE).
    *   **Reporting:** Present ŒîEVE results both in absolute terms and as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital, aligned with regulatory reporting standards.
    *   **Net Gap Analysis:** Calculate and visualize the Net Gap for the portfolio across Basel time buckets.
    *   **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilize Plotly for dynamic charts to visualize yield curves, ŒîEVE impact, and Net Gap.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get QuLab up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   `git` (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuLab.git
    cd QuLab
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/QuLab.git` with the actual repository URL if it's hosted.)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory (`QuLab/`) with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit==1.30.0
    pandas==2.1.4
    numpy==1.26.2
    scipy==1.11.4
    plotly==5.18.0
    python-dateutil==2.8.2
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üíª Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    Make sure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the `QuLab/` directory.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Application:**

    The command above will open the QuLab application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Navigate and Interact:**

    *   Use the **sidebar** on the left to navigate between different sections:
        *   **Portfolio Generation:** Start here to create your synthetic banking book. Adjust parameters like the number of instruments and Tier 1 Capital. Click "Generate Portfolio". The generated portfolio data will be saved in `st.session_state` for use in other sections.
        *   **Discount Curve:** (Assuming this page exists and is functional) View and potentially modify the baseline yield curve.
        *   **IRRBB Simulation:** (Assuming this page exists and is functional) Conduct IRRBB stress tests, apply shock scenarios, and analyze ŒîEVE and Net Gap results.

    *   Adjust input parameters using sliders, number inputs, and date pickers as provided in each section.
    *   The application uses Streamlit's caching (`@st.cache_data`) for performance, so calculations are optimized.
